# gps
unity 3d code to grab latitude and longitude.

the code simply needs the locations services enable to work else it will ask to enable the GPS of phone manually.

unless the GPS is enable there would be an error message asking to enable GPS.

after the GPS is enable and as soon as the GPS is locked the latitude and longitude is shown.
